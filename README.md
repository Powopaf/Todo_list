# Project todo_list

## Purpose :

I am writing tiny script in different language to learn and practice what I learn in school (steal a student project remenber)
The method use in the different projects are :
  - if, elif/else if, else statement 
  - how and, or and other boolean operator work
  - loop with for and while
  - how string work
  - read and write into a file

### Build Bash script
Happy day no need to run `chmod` command I did it for you already to use in bash :)
### Build C script
Only need to go in the C directory and type make
#### Note
I will not implement interface
